# Caterpillar to Chrysalis Childcare 

An application where users can visit and book time with the Nanny.


This was a 3 week long project for a client that needed a website for her nanny business. 

Website requirements included:
- Using a CMS so the business owner can change the content of the website to her liking.
- A calendar system to help the business get in touch with new clients

Technologies Used:
- Cal.co
- Strapi
- React
- NextJs
- TailWind
- NextAuth

This client project was very fun, I had to learn multiple technologies in parallel to get started. It initially took me a week just to wrap my head around the new routing system for next and nextAuth. But I was happy with the end results and the client was very pleased with the website.
